                My name is <b>Eric Steadman</b>. I'm 21, and I was raised in Orem, Utah. 
                I'm a senior in the Mathematics program, minoring in Computer Science, at 
                <a href="https://byu.edu/">Brigham Young University</a>. I like cooking,
                photography, and writing poetry. I enjoy proving things
                and I like to get in over my head and figure out things which are above my level.
                I frequently find myself researching things in my free time.
